# Nike Store (Shopping App)

Capstone project for [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) web dev bootcamp

In my ["Nike Store"](https://capstone-tew-project.vercel.app/) shopping App you can find shoes you like and buy it almost as well as you do it in a real simple online shop. You can buy it, change the amount of the shoes, you can filter it, you can see the details to each item. You can put it into the favourites and save them there. You can see the history of what and when you bought in the last days or weeks. You can also leave your feedback after you bought your shoes, and later if you change your opinion, you can change or delete your feedback as easy as you leaved it. Enjoy your shopping!

The app is responsive, however it is best viewed on a mobile device.
